/**
 * Jest, and only inside `apps/mobile`.
 *
 * The repo runs Vitest everywhere else and keeps doing so — this config does
 * not touch the root `vitest run`. The reason for the exception is that the
 * hard part of testing React Native is transforming Flow-typed `node_modules`
 * (`react-native`, every `expo-*`) and supplying the native-module mocks.
 * `jest-expo` is the only maintained preset that does both, and
 * `expo-router/testing-library` — the seam that mounts a real route by path —
 * is written against Jest's globals and `jest.mock`. Vitest can be made to work
 * and would have to be re-argued at every Expo upgrade.
 *
 * `transformIgnorePatterns` is the fiddly part under pnpm. Packages do not live
 * at `node_modules/<name>` but at `node_modules/.pnpm/<name>@<version>/node_modules/<name>`,
 * so the usual `node_modules/(?!expo|react-native|…)` allow-list matches at the
 * *first* `node_modules/` — where the next segment is `.pnpm` — and refuses to
 * transform anything. Matching the package name anywhere in the path instead is
 * what makes the ESM-only `@appelent/i18n` and the Flow-typed Expo packages
 * transformable here.
