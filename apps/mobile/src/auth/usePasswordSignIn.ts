/**
 * Email + password, all the way to an active session.
 *
 * Clerk **Core 3** (`@clerk/expo`) trap: a successful `signIn.password()`
 * leaves the sign-in `'complete'` but **not** signed in. `finalize()` is
 * what promotes it to the active session — skipping it produces a flow that
 * reports success and leaves the person exactly where they were. This is
 * genuinely different from the web app's Core 2 (`@appelent/auth` /
 * `@clerk/clerk-react`), which throws on failure and uses `setActive()`.
 *
 * Nothing here navigates. When `finalize()` lands, `isSignedIn` flips, the
 * `(auth)` layout redirects, and this component unmounts out from under the
 * caller — which is also why `busy` is only ever cleared on the failure
 * paths.
