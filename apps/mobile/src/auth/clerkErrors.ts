 * Clerk's error codes, turned into a message worth showing.

 * `{ error: ClerkError | null }` rather than throwing, and `useSignIn()`
 * additionally exposes the last fetch's errors split into `fields` and
 * `global`. Both shapes carry a machine-stable `code` and a `message` Clerk's
 * own docs say not to show to a person, so the code is what gets mapped.
 *
 * A code not in `CODE_MAP` falls back to a generic message and — in dev —
 * logs the unmapped code, so the mapping can only grow by someone noticing a
 * gap.
