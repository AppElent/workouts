/**
 * The two things read out of the environment, and the gate on the second.
 *
 * **Static dot access is load-bearing.** Metro inlines `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` by
 * textually substituting `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_NAME` at build time. It is
 * not an object at runtime: `process.env[name]`, destructuring, or a helper
 * that takes the name as an argument all yield `undefined` in a release
 * build while appearing to work in dev. Every read below is spelled out in
 * full for that reason and must stay that way.
 *
 * **The dev-login gate is the key's prefix, not `__DEV__`.** A release build
 * pointed at the test instance (e.g. a PR preview) should offer the
 * shortcut; a dev build someone has pointed at production must not. This
 * mirrors the web app's rule (`@appelent/auth`'s dev test-login button),
 * where the credentials are inlined into the client bundle either way — so
 * the account they name must never be one that exists on the live instance.
