/**
 * Holds the signed-in subtree until the Convex websocket is actually
 * authenticated.
 *
 * Clerk and Convex answer "is this user signed in?" at different moments.
 * Clerk's `isSignedIn` flips as soon as the session token is readable from
 * SecureStore; Convex only counts as authenticated once that token has been
 * minted for the Convex template, pushed over the websocket and accepted by
 * the backend. Between those two instants every `useQuery` in the subtree is
 * live and unauthenticated, and each one throws `Unauthenticated` out of
 * render — the red box the user sees on a cold start or when a stale session
 * is being refreshed.
 *
 * `(app)/_layout` keeps guarding *navigation* on Clerk's `isSignedIn` (see the
 * comment there: guarding the redirect on Convex bounces forever). This gate
 * is the other half of that split — navigation follows Clerk, data follows
 * Convex — and it sits below the redirect so the two never fight.
 *
 * It renders a bare themed surface rather than a spinner: on the common path
 * the handshake is a few hundred milliseconds behind a splash screen that is
 * still up, and a spinner that flashes for one frame reads as a glitch.
