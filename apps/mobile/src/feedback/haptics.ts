/**
 * The phone's haptic vocabulary.
 *
 * Adapted from the same module in the sibling `gather` app (spec #68, D24),
 * narrowed to the three events spec #68 actually sanctions plus the two the
 * gestures in `ui/swipeable-row.tsx` and `ui/action-menu.tsx` need to stay
 * legible without watching the screen.
 *
 * **Call sites name events, never intensities.** `haptics.entryLogged()`, not
 * `notificationAsync(Success)` — so "how hard should a logged meal feel" is
 * answered once, here, rather than re-answered by whoever writes the next
 * screen. It is also the only place Android's vocabulary diverges from iOS's,
 * and the only place a future "reduce haptics" preference would go.
 *
 * **Restraint is the point.** Spec #68: haptics are limited to *meaningful
 * selection*, *successful logging*, and *destructive warning* — not routine
 * taps. There is deliberately no `buttonPressed()` here, because adding one is
 * how an app ends up buzzing on every tap. Choosing a serving is meaningful
 * (it changes the numbers you are about to commit); scrolling a list of foods
 * is not.
 *
 * **Nothing here is ever the only signal.** iOS silently plays nothing in Low
 * Power Mode, when the user has turned haptics off, while the camera is open,
 * and during dictation. A confirmation that exists only as a buzz did not
 * happen for those people — so every call site below also draws or says the
 * same thing.
 *
 * Every call is fire-and-forget and swallows its rejection: a haptic that fails
 * is not an error worth surfacing, and it must never take a save down with it.
